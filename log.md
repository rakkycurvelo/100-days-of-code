# 100 Days Of Code - Rakky's Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued worked on my Free Code Camp curriculum, reviewing and learning some CSS. 

**Thoughts**: CSS is not my worst enemy, but it's also not my best friend. Today, I had some fun reviewing content that I have learned before and also learnings some new tricks. I have to review CCS Positioning, for sure.

### Day 2: January 03, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS Applied Visual Design on my Free Code Camp curriculum + update some CSS on an old project. 

**Thoughts**: Had fun remembering why I started this old project as an assignment for my Msc. Also, find it curious how is possible to forget things that we code ourselves. One of my lecturers used to say and she's right: COMMENT YOUR CODE!
