# 100 Days Of Code - Rakky's Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued worked on my Free Code Camp curriculum, reviewing and learning some CSS. 

**Thoughts**: CSS is not my worst enemy, but it's also not my best friend. Today, I had some fun reviewing content that I have learned before and also learnings some new tricks. I have to review CCS Positioning, for sure.

### Day 2: January 03, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Visual Design on my Free Code Camp profile + update some CSS on an old project. 

**Thoughts**: Had fun remembering why I started this old project as an assignment for my Msc. Also, find it curious how is possible to forget things that we code ourselves. One of my lecturers used to say and she's right: COMMENT YOUR CODE!

### Day 3: January 04, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Accessibility on my Free Code Camp profile. 

**Thoughts**: I haven't gone to bed yet, so it's still counting! =D - after a very confused and non-planned day, I've arrived home super late and still got the energy to do my one-hour coding. It was only some Free Code Camp stuff, but, still, I found it enough to not give up on it.

### Day 4: January 05, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Responsible Design Principles and CSS Flexbox on my Free Code Camp profile. 

**Thoughts**: This is another unusual day and I'm coding on my break from work (no, I'm not coding for work, so still following the rules). I'll do whatever it takes to keep going - also, to code for more time each day!

### Day 5: January 06, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS Grids on my Free Code Camp profile. 

**Thoughts**: I'm excited! Grids were a new thing that I've always tried to understand, failing miserably. Today, with the Free Code Camp challenges, things were way more smoothly than ever before. That's it: practice makes perfect.

### Day 6: January 07, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: My first Code Camp Challenge!  

**Thoughts**: Aaaah, a little tribute website! I confess I've spent more time than I should be trying to find a way of putting images on my recent CodePen account, but, well, I'll put that all together soon!

### Day 7: January 08, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Tribute Project!   

**Thoughts**: At the end, just having the images saved at my GitHub account is enought to use them at CodePen. Feeling silly for not having try it before (Flick, Dropbox and Google Drive didn't worked for me!). Anyways, I've finished my tribute project and that's it. Hoping to have more activities to show tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 09, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Survey Form Project!   

**Thoughts**: Not as smoothly as I thought it would be. Let's see what's next.

### Day 9: January 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started my Product Landing Page 

**Thoughts**: Back to my Survey Form, I've noticed that my autosaved was disable, which means that I've lost all my CSS for yesterday. Did it again and I'm happier with the final result. Then, I've started the HTML part for my Product Landing Page. I still don't know what product I'll put there, but, well, this is a decision for tomorrow.

### Day 10: January 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Keep updating my Product Landing Page 

**Thoughts**: I've lost one day yesterday, cause work was insanely stressful and I haven't got the strength to open my code editors. Today, I've worked more on the colours and design of my product landing page than in everything else, but I had a product idea and could execute that on my HTML.

### Day 11: January 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Keep updating my Product Landing Page 

**Thoughts**: CSS work on my landing page project and I found colours, borders and padding. Not sure on how to put my grids and media queries together though. Need a reviewing time.

### Day 12: January 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Product Landing Page 

**Thoughts**: Finished my Product Landing Page and working on some videos from Daniel Shiffman, The Nature of Code. I wish I could be more effective on this. Why am I not putting more time on this challenge?

### Day 13: January 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Starting my Technical Documentation Page

**Thoughts**: I've started to put my technical documentation page together and came across this amazing CSS Grid Template. It's impossible to not keep your page organized when you are familiar with it. This page from MDN helped me a lot and it will be a model for life! <3

### Day 14: January 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Keep working on my Technical Documentation Page

**Thoughts**: Formating HTML and CSS again. I just need to keep doing it to make a memory palace with the process. Also, it's always good to remember some [HTML characters](http://www.whatsmyip.org/html-characters/), right?

### Day 15: January 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Keep working on my Technical Documentation Page

**Thoughts**: Today was a CSS day.  I've searched for old stuff, fixed some errors on my code and put more style on my technical documentation page. I'm halfway through it now, but, for the first time, I'm not feeling late or anything... just enjoying the moment...

### Day 16: January 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Keep working on my Technical Documentation Page

**Thoughts**: Today I've finished styling my page. I want to add some JavaScript on and, since I'm using p5.js as a reference for my documentation, that might be a nice final touch.

### Day 17: January 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Technical Documentation Page

**Thoughts**: A good day to finish a page, adding simple p5.js on it. I've used some p5.js reference examples and also checked a tutorial from Daniel Shiffman on how to do it. Here's some of the links that were very useful on doing that so:

 ### Day 01: February 03, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Starting over again, with a Personal Portfolio Page

**Thoughts**: I've spent several days far away from this challenge, first because I was feeling overwhelmed, but most of all cause I'm a procrastination specialist. I'm decided to change that and, therefore, I'll start over again. I'll also keep my old file, cause it's part of my evolution process. 

Today, I've read a chapter of the book "Web Coding & Development for Dummies - All in One", by Paul McFedries and also started to work again on my Portfolio Project, from Free Code Camp. I feel that's the right thing to do, so, let's do it. Below, some links for you guys to check out.

 ### Day 02: February 04, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Making good progress with my Personal Portfolio Page

**Thoughts**: Good thing of starting over is that I feel even more inspired to keep going. Today, I've focused on CSS and remembered some floats and positioning from previous projects. I kept reading a little of the Web Coding & Development book as well. For tomorrow: finish it and try to get my first Free Code Camp certificate!

 ### Day 03: February 06, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finishing my Personal Portfolio Page

**Thoughts**: Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!!! Media Queries, I don't like you!

  ### Day 04: February 08, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finishing my Personal Portfolio Page

**Thoughts**: Still don't like Media Queries, but defo, hate viewports...

 ### Day 05: February 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Checking my FreeCodeCamp Projects

**Thoughts**: I forked the FreeCodeCamp Test file and I'm checking all my previous projects and fixing the errors. I thought that I couldn't pass a project with things missing, but, apparently, that's possible, so, before printing my Certificate and exhibit it all around the web, I'll make sure that I did everything right...

 ### Day 06: February 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Checking my FreeCodeCamp Projects

**Thoughts**: Planning is one of the most essential parts of any project. How can we expect a flawless execution with a poor plan? Reviewing my previous projects, I found some errors and I just discovered that I'll have to redesign one of them because I've used CSS Grids within a project that needed some fixed elements to be displayed. Let's go back to the board! For real, now!

 ### Day 07: February 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my portfolio website

**Thoughts**: My idea was start to work step by step on a new layout for my portfolio, but I've end up starting it from scratch and got distracted, so I haven't finished my FreeCodeCamp Projects yet. Gzuis, I need to organise myself.

 ### Day 08: February 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Working on my portfolio website

**Thoughts**: Finished to organise my portfolio in a way in which it makes sense. I've still need to do some ajustments on my CSS, and rely less on Wordpress features, but, it ok for now.

 ### Day 09: February 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: CSS practice

**Thoughts**: Today, I'm back to my FreeCodeCamp projects, to practice some CSS and finally get my certificate!

 ### Day 10: February 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: My first FreeCodeCamp Certificate

**Thoughts**: Ahá! Now I'm happy enough to show this certificate to the world. All my projects are passing the tests (even though I still need to fix some media queries! huauhahuahu). I might start a new CSS course today, but, well, that's a victory, so I better share it, right?

 ### Day 11: February 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Starting a Full-Stack course and JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp 

**Thoughts**: Committed to keeping things going here, I've started training on Lynda.com to become a full stack web-developer. I'm also starting my FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Basics course, whitch makes me feel very productive today.

 ### Day 12: February 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing WebDev Foundations and JavaScript from FreeCodeCamp 

**Thoughts**: I've done a little bit less than I should, but reviewing stuff and concepts is always a great way to get ready for new challenges. I'm also keeping my profile on Free Code Camp active, so...

 ### Day 13: February 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing JavaScript with FreeCodeCamp and Understanding Programming Foundations 

**Thoughts**: Am I the only one scared by floating-points? What about Machine Language?
