# 100 Days Of Code - Rakky's Log

### Day 1: March 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I got tired. I really got tired. I've spent days and days away from this challenge thinking on get back and also not putting a lot of thoughts on that, because of pure and simple lazyness. But this is the way and it's not easy. They say that the third is the lucky one, right? Let's prove it! 

**Thoughts**: Today I've done really important changes on my portfolio website, presenting it on a more professional way (finally), and used a tutorial to help me on building my own Wordpress child theme.
