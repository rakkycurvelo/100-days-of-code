# 100 Days Of Code - Rakky's Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued worked on my Free Code Camp curriculum, reviewing and learning some CSS. 

**Thoughts**: CSS is not my worst enemy, but it's also not my best friend. Today, I had some fun reviewing content that I have learned before and also learnings some new tricks. I have to review CCS Positioning, for sure.
