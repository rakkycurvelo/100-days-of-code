# 100 Days Of Code - Rakky's Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued worked on my Free Code Camp curriculum, reviewing and learning some CSS. 

**Thoughts**: CSS is not my worst enemy, but it's also not my best friend. Today, I had some fun reviewing content that I have learned before and also learnings some new tricks. I have to review CCS Positioning, for sure.

### Day 2: January 03, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Visual Design on my Free Code Camp profile + update some CSS on an old project. 

**Thoughts**: Had fun remembering why I started this old project as an assignment for my Msc. Also, find it curious how is possible to forget things that we code ourselves. One of my lecturers used to say and she's right: COMMENT YOUR CODE!

### Day 3: January 04, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Accessibility on my Free Code Camp profile. 

**Thoughts**: I haven't gone to bed yet, so it's still counting! =D - after a very confused and non-planned day, I've arrived home super late and still got the energy to do my one-hour coding. It was only some Free Code Camp stuff, but, still, I found it enough to not give up on it.

### Day 4: January 05, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Responsible Design Principles and CSS Flexbox on my Free Code Camp profile. 

**Thoughts**: This is another unusual day and I'm coding on my break from work (no, I'm not coding for work, so still following the rules). I'll do whatever it takes to keep going - also, to code for more time each day!

### Day 5: January 06, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished CSS Grids on my Free Code Camp profile. 

**Thoughts**: I'm excited! Grids were a new thing that I've always tried to understand, failing miserably. Today, with the Free Code Camp challenges, things were way more smoothly than ever before. That's it: practice makes perfect.

### Day 6: January 07, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: My first Code Camp Challenge!  

**Thoughts**: Aaaah, a little tribute website! I confess I've spent more time than I should be trying to find a way of putting images on my recent CodePen account, but, well, I'll put that all together soon!

### Day 7: January 08, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Tribute Project!   

**Thoughts**: At the end, just having the images saved at my GitHub account is enought to use them at CodePen. Feeling silly for not having try it before (Flick, Dropbox and Google Drive didn't worked for me!). Anyways, I've finished my tribute project and that's it. Hoping to have more activities to show tomorrow.

### Day 8: January 09, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Survey Form Project!   

**Thoughts**: Not as smoothly as I thought it would be. Let's see what's next.

### Day 9: January 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started my Product Landing Page 

**Thoughts**: Back to my Survey Form, I've noticed that my autosaved was disable, which means that I've lost all my CSS for yesterday. Did it again and I'm happier with the final result. Then, I've started the HTML part for my Product Landing Page. I still don't know what product I'll put there, but, well, this is a decision for tomorrow.

### Day 10: January 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Keep updating my Product Landing Page 

**Thoughts**: I've lost one day yesterday, cause work was insanely stressful and I haven't got the strength to open my code editors. Today, I've worked more on the colours and design of my product landing page than in everything else, but I had a product idea and could execute that on my HTML.

### Day 11: January 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Keep updating my Product Landing Page 

**Thoughts**: CSS work on my landing page project and I found colours, borders and padding. Not sure on how to put my grids and media queries together though. Need a reviewing time.
